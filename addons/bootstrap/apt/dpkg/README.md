# Upstream

This is a copy of <https://github.com/Quentin-M/dpkgcomp.git> at revision 46af647236674a287322d02a311f58ec3997db5a with the following changes

- README replaced
- Package name changed to dpkg
- Minor code reformatting & error string changes to adapt to local linter rules
- Fix broken tests

## Why

Upstream seems unmaintained and has no `go.mod`.

> A little copying is better than a little dependency
